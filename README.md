> A roguelike for PICO-8. The music tracks (Greensleeves / Ballet in D / Belle Qui Tiens Ma Vie / Les Plaisirs de Saint Germain en Laÿe) are adapted from midi files made by [Lory Werths](https://mandolingals.tripod.com/). Most of the sprites are from [chare](https://egordorichev.itch.io/chare) and [toi](https://egordorichev.itch.io/toi) made by [egordorichev](https://www.lexaloffle.com/bbs/?uid=24809). The cherry and orange sprites (though slightly modified) were made by [Justin Cyr](https://x.com/JUSTIN_CYR/status/634546317713391616). The tomato plant sprite is from [JumpStart](https://oddpotatodev.itch.io/jumpstart-8x8-platformer-asset-pack) by [OrdinaryCicada](https://oddpotatodev.itch.io/).
